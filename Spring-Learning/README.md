# 🌱 Spring Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Spring Framework learning journey**!  
This repository contains hands-on practice, and personal notes based on chapters from the book ["Spring Start Here: Learn what you need and learn it well by  Laurentiu Spilca"](https://laurspilca.com/spring-start-here/) that I'm working through. It is structured to help reinforce core Spring concepts through code and documentation.


## 📚 Structure

Each folder inside this repo corresponds to a chapter from the book, and contains:

- 📝 **Notes** — Personal summaries of key concepts
- 💻 **Exercises** — Practical examples and code walkthroughs based on the chapter


## 🗂️ Chapter Folders Overview

> Folder names follow a `chapter-X` pattern for clarity and chronological order.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a solid understanding of the Spring Framework and Spring Boot
- Practice realistic application development patterns
- Prepare for creating full-stack or microservice applications using Spring
- Use this as a reference repo for future projects or interviews

## 📌 Technologies Practiced
- Spring Core (DI, Bean scopes, ApplicationContext)
- Spring AOP
- Spring MVC
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA & JDBC
- Spring Security (eventually)
- Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito)
